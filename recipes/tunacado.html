     <p>Hello again and welcome to my last iteration for now. Today, I want to talk about the tunacado from Joe & The Juice, it's amazing. So I have a copycat recipe here so I also don't lose it. <i>I don't always make it into a sandwich, I honestly just make the filling and eat with whatever.</i></p>
        <h3>The Tuna Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>canned tuna</li>
                <li>mayonnaise</li>
                <li>dijon mustard</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>jalapeños</li>
                <li>cilantro</li>
                <li>red onion</li>
                <li>lime juice</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Start by adding the tuna to a bowl. Mash it up with a fork or pestle to break it apart. Add the mayo, mustard, salt, black pepper, diced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, diced red onion, and lemon juice. Mix together until it’s smooth and creamy. That’s it</p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> Joe & the Juice actually turns their tuna into a fluffy and creamy mousse by putting it into a food processor. Feel free to do this if you’d like but just add the onions, jalapeños, and cilantro after blending it. I prefer a bit more texture so I just used a pestle to mash it so it’s almost like a mousse but not quite yet</p>
        <p><b>SECOND NOTE:</b> There we go again with the food processor, I should really just make the investment huh</p>
        <p><b>THIRD NOTE:</b> You noticed how I don't have measurements for the ingredients, that's cause I do it based on vibes. So just feel it out and listen to your heart.</p>
    <h3>For the sandwich part, you'll need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough Bread</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a grill or panini press and spray with oil. Add two slices of bread per sandwich and toast until crispy and golden brown.</li>
            <li>On one side of the bread, add a layer of pesto, then avocado, next tomato, and tuna. Add chipotle mayo on the other slice of bread and close the sandwich shut.</li>
            <li>Cut in half and enjoy with your favorite hot sauce.</li>
        </ol>
